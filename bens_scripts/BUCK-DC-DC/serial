Thanks again. I was able to get it working at 9600 8N1.

Notes:
– UART pin labels (RX/TX) are opposite from what I expected. The pin labelled RX is actually the TX pin on the MCU and vice versa.
– Commands must be prefixed with a colon. This is a bit unclear in the document.
– Auto power-on state doesn’t read properly. It always returns 0, indicating that auto power-on is disabled.

Example communication:

:wo0
#wook
:wo1
#wook
:wu1000
#wuok
:wi0100
#wiok
:wl1
#wlok
:wl0
#wlok
:ru
#ru00000001000
:ri
#ri00000000000
:rt
#rt00000000003
:rc
#rc00000000000
:rv
#rv00000001000
:ra
#ra00000000100
:ro
#ro00000000001


I’ve written commands to the buck converter and it reads them. When I send “:wu0700\r\n” as bytes it sets the voltage to 7 V, however, I am still not able to read any feedback (as far as I can tell). Like in the example, I haven’t been able to read in “#wuok”.
