Here is a protocol for your reference.
1, write commands
(1) wu command (set the output voltage range of power supply 0000-6000)
The format is: awuxxxx + 0x0d + 0x0a)
“xxxx” is voltage set point, for example
awu1234 indicates that the output voltage is set to 12.34V
awu0123 indicates that the output voltage is set to 01.23V
(2) wi command (set the output current range of power supply 0000-0800)
The format is: awixxxx + 0x0d + 0x0a
“xxxx” is the current set point, for example
: awi0100 indicates the set output current value is 01.00A
: awi0799 that set the output current is 07.99A
(3) wo command (turn on or off power output)
The format is: awox + 0x0d + 0x0a
“x” represents the module output state, for example
: awo1 said to turn on the output
: awo0 means to close the output
(4) wl command (turn on or off the lock function)
The format is: wlx + 0x0d + 0x0a
“x” indicates the module lock status, for example
: awl1 means to turn on the lock function
: awl0 means to turn off the lock function
(5) wm command (call out parameters, 0-9 address bits)
The format is: awmx + 0x0d + 0x0a
“x” represents the address of the calling parameter, for example
: awm0 is to call out the parameters of 0 address bits
: awm9 is to call out the parameters of 9 address bits

u command（read the actual output voltage）
The format is: aru+0x0d+0x0a
For example, #ru00000000488 it means the actual output voltage is 4.88V
ri command (read the actual output current)
The format is: ari+0x0d+0x0a
For example, #ri00000000087, it means the actual output current is 0.87A
